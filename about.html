    <p>
      I like builing and making stuff in general, Fashion design (shoes,
      clothing, bags, accessories..), Carpentry, Metal works, general
      engineering...I love learning new things, taking on new challenges, and creating. <br /><br />
      Most of the things I like and want don't really exist in the
      way I wish them, so I learn the skill and make them myself... And now I'm learning to code so I can do and build some other stuff...
      <br /><br />
      Don't do much in the way of sports, but when I do, I prefer Golf and
      baseball.
